# Node environment
Docker environment with node 8 for Laravel (based on official node docker hub repository).

[Source code](https://github.com/dimadeush/laravel-node.git)

## Requirements
* Docker version 18.06 or later
* Docker compose version 1.22 or later

## Additional info:
Based on the popular Alpine Linux project. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.
